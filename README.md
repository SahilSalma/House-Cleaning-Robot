# House-Cleaning-Robot
This is a robot similar to a Roomba. Looking at my current estimates and research I can say that the robot will be much cheaper than 
its current competition in the market. It is being designed for middle class population of countries like India. The robot is designed
to sweep the floor followed by mopping it.
